## Download && Install

Hit up one of the following links to install the precompiled extension package.

* [Google Chrome](https://github.com/weetidy/Pull-to-refresh-for-Chrome-and-Safari/raw/master/chrome/pull_to_refresh.crx) (v1.1)
* [Safari](https://github.com/weetidy/Pull-to-refresh-for-Chrome-and-Safari/raw/master/Pull%20to%20Refresh.safariextz)

## Current support: Google Chrome and Safari on Mac OS X Lion
Enables pull to refresh functionality on every page in your browser. This is only truly supported on Mac OS X Lion due to the multitouch scrolling capabilities and negative scrolling of the web page.

## Changelog

#### Version 1.1

* Stopped pull to refresh from working if you scroll up the page quickly, as this isn't desired behaviour.
* Allowed release from pull to refresh if you scroll back down again.
* Change CSS3 transforms to JS as it was causing UI flickering in chrome.
