## Changelog

#### Version 1.1.1 (minor)

* Removed nice CSS3 animation of the arrow. This is causing UI glitches in chrome.

#### Version 1.1

* Stopped pull to refresh from working if you scroll up the page quickly, as this isn't desired behaviour.
* Allowed release from pull to refresh if you scroll back down again.

## Current support: Google Chrome and Safari on Mac OS X Lion
Enables pull to refresh functionality on every page in your browser. This is only truly supported on Mac OS X Lion due to the multitouch scrolling capabilities and negative scrolling of the web page.
